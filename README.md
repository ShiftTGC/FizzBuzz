# FizzBuzz
Originally a small thing I made thanks to Tom Scott's FizzBuzz video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPZ0pIK_wsc)

I recommend that you do NOT use my source code or look at it. Not yet anyhow.
I recommend you first try and make your own version of a FizzBuzz generator. (I recommend watching the video I mentioned till 1:25)
Another reason I don't recommend looking at my code is... Well, it is messy to say the least.
